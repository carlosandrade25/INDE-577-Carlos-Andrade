# Data sciencie and Machine Learining INDE 577
Rice-INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning
This repository is created by Carlos A. Andrade, a graduate student of the Industrial Engineering program at Rice University. It contains all projects createdfor INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning ,course instrucdted by Dr. Randy Davila during the Spring 2022 semester. This course covers algorithms from supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Mostly of the code is base on classrrom example and using the textbook :Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron.

This curse provides the mathematical concepts, tools, and logic to implement programs capable of learning from data, or extacrcat important information from data. It covers a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression, to some of the Deep Learning techniques. 

The following are the algorith that have been developed and posted on this Github:
