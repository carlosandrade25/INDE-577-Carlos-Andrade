This repository is created by Carlos A. Andrade, a Colombian graduate student of the Industrial Engineering program at Rice University. This folder contains all projects created for the course INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning, instructed by Dr. Randy Davila during the Spring 2022 semester. This course covers techniques for supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Mostly of the code is base on classroom examples and using the textbook Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron.

This curse provides the mathematical concepts, tools, and logic to implement programs capable of learning and extracting key information from data. It covers a large number of techniques, from the simplest and most commonly algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression, to some of the Deep Learning techniques. 

The following are the algorithms that have been developed and posted on this Github:

### [Initial Analysis:](https://github.com/carlosandrade25/INDE-577-Carlos-Andrade/tree/main/Initial_analysis)
- Gradient descent
- Data pre-processing and PCA Analysis

### [Supervised Learning:](https://github.com/carlosandrade25/INDE-577-Carlos-Andrade/tree/main/Supervised-Learning)
- The K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forest
- Neural Networks

### [Unsupervised Learning:](https://github.com/carlosandrade25/INDE-577-Carlos-Andrade/tree/main/Unsupervised_learning)
- The K-Means Clustering
  
## Data base

The database used for this project is the evaluation of the cup quality of Arabica coffee from 15 different countries, including Colombia, one of the largest exporters of high-quality Arabica coffee worldwide, and my country of origin. The main motivation was learning new tools to analyze data coming for this higly important economic sector for my country. The general idea is to use all these algorithms to be able to identify Colombian coffee based on cup quality and environmental parameters such as altitude above sea level. The raw data contain reviews of 1312 arabica coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's trained reviewers. The Quality Measures includes:

- Aroma
- Flavor
- Aftertaste
- Acidity
- Body
- Balance
- Uniformity
- Cup Cleanliness
- Sweetness
- Moisture
- Defects

The farm metadata includes: 
- Processing Method
- Color
- Species (arabica / robusta)
- Farm Metadata
- Owner
- Country of Origin
- Farm Name
- Lot Number
- Mill
- Company
- Altitude
- Region

# Brief History of Coffee in the world, and Colombia

<p align="center"> <img src="cafe.jpg" width="428"/> </p>

Coffee came out from Africa (Ethiopia), where was initially consumed in infusions or by chewing the leaves of the coffee plant, but it was the Arabians who were responsible for its expansion, arriving in Turkey in 1544 and them moving around middle east and eventually worldwide. In the 17th century, coffee was introduced to Europe through the port of Venice (Italy) and expanded across the continent to finally reach South America by the 18th century. It believes that the Dutch were responsible for this expansion across new continents, who didn’t want to depend on the Arabians. This is how, at the beginning of the 18th century, the Netherlands came to be the production leaders of the world.  One of the theories about how coffee arrived in South America is that Dutch introduced it through what is known today as Suriname, exported it to Colombia and Brazil. By the 19th century, it had become of great importance in farming which was also influenced by the fact that by the middle of 19th century, a disease called coffee rust attacked the crops of Ceylon, (Sri Lanka), who at that time were the main coffee producers.

Coffee in Colombia has about 200 years of history since the Jesuits brought it to the country in the 18th century. In 1835, the first bags produced in the eastern zone were exported from Cucuta’s (a city close to Venezuelan border) customs office. Legend said the increase of coffee production in Colombia happened thanks to the Jesuit Priest Francisco Romero, in a small town in the State of Santander named Salazar de Las Palmas. When his parishioners confessed, the priest imposed on them sowing coffee as a penance to redeem their sins. Thanks to this, it is said that the coffee production began to expand to other States, and by 1850, coffee had reached Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and Caldas.

By the end of 19th century, production had increased from 60,000 bags to more than 600,000 bags –most of this production came from the farms of the largest landowners – and at the beginning of the 20th century, coffee was already the main foreign exchange export product in Colombia. The transition from the 19th to the 20th century brought a great fall in the international market prices and therefore a crisis for the landowners. This crisis favored the small producers that were growing, and the Colombian west zone became the leader in coffee development. In 1927 the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros was created, which was responsible for aiding and representing the coffee growers to ensure their rights. In addition, in 1938 the Research Centre, CENICAFE was born, it was responsible for many achievements like the “Castillo” variety, resistant to diseases such as rust and one of the main coffee varieties that is grown in Colombia today. In 1959 two important events occurred: The Character of Juan Valdez was born, and the office of Café de Colombia was opened in Tokyo, making Japan today the second consumer of Colombian coffee in the world.
