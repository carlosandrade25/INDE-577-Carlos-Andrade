## INITIAL ANALYSIS

Data preprocessing is a step in the data mining and data analysis process that takes raw data and transforms it into a format that can be understood and analyzed by computers and machine learning. Raw, real-world data in the form of text, images, video, etc., is messy. Not only may it contain errors and inconsistencies, but it is often incomplete, and doesn’t have a regular, uniform design.Machines like to process nice and tidy information – they read data as 1s and 0s. So calculating structured data, like whole numbers and percentages is easy. However, unstructured data, in the form of text and images must first be cleaned and formatted before analysis.

When using data sets to train machine learning models, you’ll often hear the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” This means that if you use bad or “dirty” data to train your model, you’ll end up with a bad, improperly trained model that won’t actually be relevant to your analysis. 

Good, preprocessed data is even more important than the most powerful algorithms, to the point that machine learning models trained with bad data could actually be harmful to the analysis you’re trying to do – giving you “garbage” results.

### Project

The project called Data preprocesing and PCA Analysis aims to analize, filer, remove undisered elements and find the best elemnts to profrom the follorwed supervise and unsupervice machine learning algorith. Thats why is super important and the first step of the whole history of this project. In addiion, gradiente descent algorithm, which is a very important capstone of machine learning, is developed from scratch and implement for some mathematic functions.
