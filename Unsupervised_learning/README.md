# Unsupervise Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. 

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself.  For instance, suppose it is given an image having both dogs and cats which it has never seen.

Thus the machine has no idea about the features of dogs and cats so we can’t categorize it as ‘dogs and cats ‘. But it can categorize them according to their similarities, patterns, and differences, i.e., we can easily categorize the above picture into two parts. The first may contain all pics having dogs in them and the second part may contain all pics having cats in them. Here you didn’t learn anything before, which means no training data or examples. 

It allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with unlabelled data.

Unsupervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms: 
 
Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.

Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

## Projects

For unsupervised machine learning, we will work on k means clustering alogrith (In adition, PCA analysis which is also an unsupevise algorithm, is used in the project Data preprocesing and PCA Analysis). The file will describe the basic components of the algorithm, the specific task and some cool fact about coffee that motivates that analysis.
