## Supervised learning

Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the 
machine using data that is well labeled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new 
set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from 
labeled data. 

For instance, suppose you are given a basket filled with different kinds of fruits. Now the first step is to train the machine with all different fruits 
one by one like this:

If the shape of the object is rounded and has a depression at the top, is red in color, then it will be labeled as –Apple.
If the shape of the object is a long curving cylinder having Green-Yellow color, then it will be labeled as –Banana. 

Supervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms: 
 
- Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
- Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

Advantages:-

Supervised learning allows collecting data and produces data output from previous experiences.
Helps to optimize performance criteria with the help of experience.
Supervised machine learning helps to solve various types of real-world computation problems.

Disadvantages:-

Classifying big data can be challenging.
Training for supervised learning needs a lot of computation time. So, it requires a lot of time.
